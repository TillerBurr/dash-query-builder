\title{DashQueryBuilder component}

\description{
DashQueryBuilder is a Dash Component based on [`react-awesome-query-builder`](https://github.com/ukrbublik/react-awesome-query-builder).  It takes a `fields` property to generate the options for building the actual query. The optional property `tree` is used to define the current state of the tree. It can be used to define the starting state of the query builder. The optional property `theme` is one of `material`, `mui`, `antd`, `bootstrap` or `basic`. This is the styling of the component. These are the only themes supported by `react-awesome-query-builder`.
